This is a temporary fork of https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL as currently the
their AAR based distribution is broken on X86 based devices (for example
accelerated emulators).  I hope to solve that upstream and update this
to a much simpler structure that uses their AAR based distribution.

For details about the Acid Warp for Android project, see the README at:
